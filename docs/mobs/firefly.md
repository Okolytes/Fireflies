# Firefly
---

Likely the main reason for downloading this mod, Fireflies are passive flying mobs that are scattered across the world coming in all kind of bright and flashy flavours.

## Drops
---

Upon death, adult bees drop 1–3 experience orbs when killed by a player or tamed wolf.

Upon breeding successfully, 1–7 experience orbs are dropped.

Like other baby animals, killing a baby bee yields no experience.

## Behavior
---

Fireflies do not fly (like ghasts or the ender dragon), but instead hover a few blocks above the ground similar to bats and parrots.

Fireflies are considered arthropods and take increased damage from the Bane of Arthropods enchantment. They also take damage when touching water.

Like most passive mobs, they can be attached to leads.

Fireflies usually stay within 8 blocks from other fireflies, and keep close together if possible. 

### Honey Blocks

Fireflies really like honey. They can be bred with honey bottles, provided the conditions are right, (see [Breeding](#Breeding)) and will follow a player around if they are holding either a block of honey or a bottle of honey.

## Breeding
---

If fireflies are given a Bottle of Honey, they enter love mode and pair up to create baby fireflies, granting the player 1-7 experience.

To fall in love, they require a light level of 4 or under, in a similar sense to mob spawning. This means they can breed during the night, or when in a dark room. Redstone fireflies are exempt from this rule.
